Test Bot!

A bot we can use for testing purposes.

?hello ->
	says hello

?purge ->
    Mass Delete Messages that have key prefixes.
    For testing purposes.
    Right now, it deletes all messages with '!',
    '?', and '&' in it

?voice ->
    For joining/leaving the author's voice channel

    Simply joins and leaves the voice channel, for now
    Maybe we can use this to plays songs, potentially?

    Example:

    Me: ?voice
    Bot: Joining Your Voice Channel

    Me: ?voice
    Bot: Leaving Your Voice Channel

?help ->
	This message.
