__init__.py

This is just needed when 
importing folders.

Having an __init__ file basically 
tells the program to include this 
folder as a library to look in 
when importing something

So, 'voice' folder basically just
contains all of the files related 
to the music/voice features in this project

Music Features heavily based on the discord.py music example
found @ https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/blob/master/examples/playlist.py
